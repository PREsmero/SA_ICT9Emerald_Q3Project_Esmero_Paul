    <div class="text-white bg-dark container-fluid w-50"><p class="center">Career:</p> <br>

<p>Peter Cullen is a voice actor, starting in the 1960’s.
His first few roles (not just limited to voice acting) were:
Commander Bi Bi La Tuque  for the 1969 childrens show: The Buddies.
A radio announcer in his home town of Montreal. 
An announcer for the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.
And more.
But then, in the 1980’s Cullen auditioned for the role of the robot character Optimus Prime at a casting house in Burbank, California.
It was an “opportunity of the year” Peter said.
He ended up getting the opportunity, and not only that, he also got the role of autobot Ironhide.
Optimus Prime’s character became very successful, and since then he has changed the lives of kids and adults who have watched the numerous Transformers shows and movies that exist.
Peter never knew that Optimus Prime would change the lives of kids and adults, and never knew that the character he voiced would be really famous. An example of that would be when they first killed Optimus Prime in the first Transformers movie in 1986. Kids were left distraught and were seen leaving the theater after seeing the fallen hero.
And due to Optimus Prime's popularity, in the new Transformers season in 1986-1987, they revived Optimus Prime due to the numerous fan requests.
Peter has then gotten many more voice opportunities rather than just Optimus Prime.
